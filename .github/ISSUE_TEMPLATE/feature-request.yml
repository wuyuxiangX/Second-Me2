              > To save time for both you and us, try follow these guidelines before submitting a feature request:
              > 1. Check if there is an existing feature request that is similar to your on our Github.
              > 2. We encourage you to first discuss your idea on a [Github discussion](https://github.com/mindverse/Second-Me/discussions/categories/ideas) or the **#ideas** channel of our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GpWHQNUwrg).
              > This step helps in understanding the new feature and determining if it's can be implemented at all.
              Only proceed with this report if your idea was approved after the GitHub/Discord discussion.
