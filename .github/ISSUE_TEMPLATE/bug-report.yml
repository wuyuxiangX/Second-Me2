              > To save time for both you and us, try follow these guidelines before submitting a new issue:
              > 1. Check if there is an existing issue tracking your bug on our Github.
              > 2. When unsure if your issue is an actual bug, first discuss it on a [Github discussion](https://github.com/mindverse/Second-Me/discussions/new?category=q-a) or other project communication channels.
              > These steps avoid opening issues which are duplicate or not actual bugs.
